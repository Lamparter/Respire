### 🤔 What is this?

_What if you only needed one CI?_

What if, instead of having a complex `actions` setup, you only needed one CI `yaml` source file, with almost no code in it, and a CI that automatically detects your build configuration automatically (specifically aimed at `msbuild`-based projects) and runs/tests it with almost no context at all?
Well, you say, _wouldn't that be excellent_?
**This repository aims to actually *do* that.**
